Overview
This document provides an overview of the tech stack used in the development of the OnlineStore app.

Tech Stack
The following technologies were utilized to build the project:

React: React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building interactive UIs.

ReactQuery: ReactQuery is a data-fetching library for React applications. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server-state data in the application.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a set of low-level utility classes, allowing developers to rapidly build custom and responsive UI designs.

Deployment
The project was deployed using Netlify, a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment process for web applications. Netlify offers continuous deployment, easy scalability, and integration with version control systems such as GitHub.

Conclusion
The tech stack consisting of React, ReactQuery, Tailwind CSS, and deployment through Netlify has enabled us to build a modern and efficient web application for OnlineStore. The combination of these technologies allowed for a smooth development process and ensured a seamless user experience.
